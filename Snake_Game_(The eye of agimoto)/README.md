Snake Game </br>
Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The concept originated in the 1976 two-player arcade game Blockade from Gremlin Industries, and the ease of implementing Snake has led to hundreds of versions (some of which have the word snake or worm in the title) for many platforms. 1982's Tron arcade game, based on the movie, includes Snake gameplay for the single-player Light Cycles segment, cementing a connection between the two. </br>
